# My Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity

## Motivation

This is a record of my projects completed during my fruitful Data Analyst Nanodegree.
After graduating from this degree, there are still large rooms for improvement in the projects, in terms of code style, efficiency and data analysis. Therefore this
repository serves as a milestone and starting point for future iteration.

Projects include:
- Conversion Rate A/B Test
- Data Analysis of the Kaggle Hospital No-show Appointment Dataset
- Data Wrangling for a Dog Rating Twitter Dataset
- Loan Data Visualisation and Slide Presentation

## Getting Started

You may simply git clone this repository, start an virtual environment and use
your favourite IPython editor to run the codes. Instruction specific to the
projects are in their own readmes.

```
Anaconda
Jupyter Notebook
